        <h1>Hello.</h1> 
        <p>My name is Simone</p>
        <p>Current Status: Final year university student</p>

        <!-- About Me -->I like to sit back and zone out
        <p>I like to sit back and zone out by watching various entertaining videos and streams online</p>
        <p>My ideal type of video would be humorous, informative and surprising. This could also describe my ideal life</p>

        <!-- a section of my elevator pitch I wrote at the beginning of my course --> A past elevator pitch
        <p>Through my major, I have experienced working in teams to create programs with the Nao robot. This involved Digital Literacy where we used a range of digital technologies to use and disseminate information by researching which actions were possible. In a way, this also developed my Critical Thinking skills by evaluating which movements of the robot would be natural.</p>

        <p>My goal is to work within the technological field where I think my passion for using creativity to find new ways to solve problems will prepare me in the industry. As I experience and progress in my studies, I aspire to develop my learning to be able to improve in programming and eventually create my own programs.</p>
