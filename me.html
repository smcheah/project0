            <blockquote>
                <p>Through my major, I have experienced working in teams to create programs with the NAO robot and other embedded systems. This involved digital literacy where we used a range of digital technologies to use and disseminate information by researching which actions were possible. In a way, this also developed my critical thinking and problem solving skills by evaluating the most correct solutions we could find. For example, finding the most natural movements for a robot.</p>

                <p>My goal is to work within the technology field where I think my passion for using creativity to find new ways to solve problems will prepare me in the industry. As I experience and progress in my studies, I aspire to develop my learning to be able to improve in programming and eventually create my own products.</p>
